    <ul class="writings">
        <li>I get jealous when someone has your attention and it's not even because I am needy or insecure. I just
            don't want someone to realize how amazing you are and for them to steal you away from me. I just really
            do not want to lose you to someone else......😇</li>


        <li>No one has ever gotten me like you. I ve never found anyone who makes me laugh like you and you are the
            one person who I can honestly see myself happy with..</li>


        <li>I've made mistakes in my life. I let people take advantage of me and I accept less than I deserve. But
            I've learned from my bad choices and even though there are some things I could never get back and people
            who will never say sorry. I'll know better nxt time and I'll not settle for anything less than I
            deserve.😌</li>



        <li>The best love is unexpected u don't just pick someone and cross your fingers. It will workout. You meet
            them by fate and it's a instant connection and the chemistry share is way above your head. You just talk
            and notice the way their lips curve when they smile or color of their eyes and all at once You know you
            are either lucky or you're screwed.......✌️</li>



        <li>I love spending time with you, even if we do nothing. No matter what, when I am with you, everything
            seems better...🕑</li>



        <li>If you are alone, I'll be your shadow. If you wanna cry, I'll be your shoulder. If you are not
            happy,I'll be your smile. And if u need me, I'll always be yours....👫</li>




        <li>The one who pop up like notification when you are listening to love ka songs then he not the one for
            you, but while listening to breakup songs is the real one.....💭</li>




        <li>Aise kyun uske hothon pe accha lagtha hai mere naam, Aise kyun kuch bhi bole woh mann mein ghulta hain
            Zaafraan, Girta hai gulmohar khwabon mein rath bhar, Aise khwabon se Bahar nikalna zaruri hai kya🎵</li>



        <li>Tum itne aasaan nahi ho bhoolna....😔</li>



        <li>Don't expect anything from anyone,
            however close they may be to you...</li>



        <li>You are my beginning, middle and end...</li>



        <li>Iss competition mein aap mujhse kabhi nahi jeet Sakti....
            Iss competition mein haarne ka apna maza hai...🤝</li>




        <li>To that friend who was always there, who never got tired of listening to my problems.. Thank you. I owe
            you alot :)👱</li>



        <li>We were not in a relationship, but when you told me you went on a date with someone else it felt a lot
            like jealousy, we were never in a relationship but whenever we talk our conversations never seemed to
            end, we were not in a relationship but whenever we go out I never felt like leaving your hand, we were
            never in a relationship but I swear to god that I was helplessly in love with you, we were never in a
            relationship but I know we could have been the sweetest thing in the entire world....🤌🌷</li>





        <li>I no longer fall for promises. I no longer fall for the words. I fall for the efforts they make. I fall
            for the things they do to make me stay in their life. Honestly, no longer have the strength to be
            someone's backup plan, or to be the second choice. Either am important to you or I am walking
            awayy....😌</li>



        <li>Someone unattainable who crushes your heart everyday, but in a sweet way😆</li>




        <li>Dear Rishi singh shekawath,
            You had me at "Hello future wife". You see old school romantics like me will always be in love with
            love. When you fell for dimple, I knew I wanted to be treated in the same way when I finally fall in
            love💋</li>




        <li>Don't my 3am person, because when you'll leave these 3 hours are going to haunt me for the rest of the
            night....💭</li>



        <li>Tum se hi din hota hai, Surmai shaam aati hai
            Tum se hi, tum se hi, Har ghadi saans aati hai
            Zindagi kehlati hai, Tum se hi, tum se hi....🎵</li>




        <li>You can love someone and still choose to say goodbye to them, You can miss a person and still be glad
            that they are no longer in your life....🌺</li>




        <li>Feels like 2022 was a complete lesson about relationships, friends and family...🍂</li>



        <li>Amma,<br>
            I am so grateful to have a mom like you. Caring, loving. You will always be my number one. I love you
            Ammaa.</li>



        <li>May be someday we won't talk like we used to, we won't meet, we won't text each other, you know what
            that doesn't going to change anything. I will still love you the same way and you will always be my
            Favorite Person🥺</li>




        <li>Khudko accept karna sabse mushkil hai par sabse zaroori bhi, sab kehte hai Tum Jaise bhi ho accept
            yourself...💯</li>




        <li>Because my love for you is higher than words...✨</li>




        <li>We should love ourselves so fiercely, that when others see us they know exactly how it should be
            done....#selflove🙂</li>




        <li>Khud pe daya karna bandh karo, aur khud se pyaar karna seekho....🩹❤️</li>



        <li>Not every time soulmates are lovers...... Sometimes it's best friends also...✨♥️</li>




        <li>Andhera Tera mene leliya....mere ujla sitara tere naam kiya...💕</li>




        <li>Do you miss me, how I miss you fiercely...Batao?🤔</li>




        <li>Will you be my dawn for every single day of mine....😉</li>




        <li>What exactly love is Attraction! No. Attachment! No way!.. Love is when you are with someone You feel
            complete...You don't feel the person someone else.. It's your part 💝<3< /li>





        <li>And on the days you don't know what to choose......choose your mental health 🙂</li>




        <li>I guarantee that we'll have tough times, and I guarantee that at some point one or both of us will want
            to get out. But I also guarantee that if don't ask you to be mine.. I'll regret it for the rest of my
            life...🌹</li>




        <li>As a person the hardest thing I had to learn is detachement. When you are happy on your own and don't
            take things personally it changes you as a person. People have right to choose what makes them happy,
            sometimes we are not included and that's okay🙂</li>




        <li>Sorry if I text you so much. You're all have right now....🙂</li>




        <li>Isn't it funny how someone could be on your mind everyday and they could never know...</li>




        <li>May we never find replacements for each other...</li>




        <li>Nothing hurts more than watching them sharing the same bond with somebody else that once You used to
            share...</li>




        <li>I have you, and that makes me smile everytime I think about it...</li>




        <li>There was before you and there was during you. For some reason, never thought there would be an after
            you. But there was, and I was in it...</li>




        <li>I want to watch "Yeh jawaani Hai Deewani" on the big screen, at the beach, under the stars...🥲</li>




        <li>It hurts not having you close, the long distance between us it hurts so much... spending alot of time
            alone in exchange of very little time with you.. missing that smile and missing that smell of yours..and
            finally feeling jealous of people who get to see you everyday......</li>




        <li>I am sorry I constantly want to talk to you... am sorry when you take long to reply that I get sad...I
            am sorry if you don't want to talk to me as much as I want to talk to you....</li>




        <li>Not everyone deserves your patience...</li>



        <li>Stop carrying old feelings into new Experiences......</li>




        <li>Why is it that the ones we want are always the ones we can't have...?</li>





        <li>Hey, when can I see you?
            I can never get enough of youu....</li>






        <li>I wanna start first moment of new year with youu...
            I want to say that you are the best thing happened to me.. I am grateful to have you in my life and I
            look forward to all the wonderful things we will do together in the new year..... I am happy that you've
            made it this far and you are still with me.....</li>






        <li>Aasan nahi hai tumse pyaar karna, magar tumse pyaar naa karna usse bhi zyaadha muskhil....</li>




        <li>Sometimes we have to forget how we feel....</li>




        <li>Sometimes everything cries in you, except
            your eyes....</li>




        <li>Dear self,<br>
            Stop searching for ways to make people love you and accept you. You are who you are don't let anyone
            change you or underestimate you, the most important thing you should do is to follow your dreams, love
            yourself and care about your OWN happiness! Life is too short so enjoy every moment. Even in your bad
            days smile and stay positive. The best is yet to come sweetheart...!<br>

            Love,<br>
            Me.</li>





        <li>Don't be too happy when people say they love you and they care for you. The real question is until when?
            Because just like the seasons the people also change... remember!....</li>





        <li>Let everything happen to you, no feeling is final!</li>





        <li>Just give some time, everything will fall into place...</li>





        <li>Life is all about adjustment between your feeling and reality.... there are so many situations in ur
            life where you have to quit your feeling and accept the reality....</li>




        <li>Some days we feel and look terrible and we're still learning to love ourselves on "Those days"...</li>





        <li>Okayy changes!! I understand you, it's fyn please don't be permanent cause I can't handle you for longer
            periods.....</li>



        <li>You got the best version of me, but why the fuck I still feel useless...</li>



        <li>May be in another life time, I'll find you again and it will be different...</li>




        <li>If I ever decide to give up on you, you need to understand how much that took out of me. I'm the type
            who give endless chances, always has your back and truly accepts you for who you are. So if i decided to
            give up on you understand that it took everything that left inside of me to leave you alone.....</li>





        <li>How do tell you, how much you mean to me. If I could, I would write a book or may be a letter or two:
            But you know how I suck at expressing myself. So I just wanna tell you whenever you need me you'll find
            me right there, right beside you. To hold your hand or to just listen you as you rant about your day..
        </li>




        <li>
            <ol>Self care
                <li>If it feels wrong, don't do it.</li>
                <li>Say exactly what is on your mind.</li>
                <li>Trust your intuition. </li>
                <li>Never speak bad about yourself.</li>
                <li>Don't be afraid to say yes. </li>
                <li>Don't be afraid to say no.</li>
                <li>Love openly and loudly...</li>
            </ol>

        <li>I think is better than forcing things to happen....</li>




        <li>Once we love ourselves people no longer
            look good to us unless they are good for us...</li>





        <li>If someone leaves you despite you being all nice to them, it doesn't necessarily mean that there's
            anything wrong with you. It's for them to realize what they lost. Not everything is your fault, not
            everything happens to teach you a lesson. Sometimes it's for the other person also. You know how we say
            everyone comes into your life to serve a purpose, maybe you came into their life to teach them the value
            of real love and care...</li>






        <li>Just for once, I want someone to feel what exactly I feel. Just for once, I want someone to be afraid of
            letting me go. Just for once.</li>





        <li>When I say I love you more, I don't mean I love you more than you love me, I mean I love you more than
            the bad days ahead of us, I love you more than any fight we will ever have, I love you more than the
            distance between us, love you more than any obstacle that could try and come between us. I love you the
            most.</li>





        <li>Apparently people leave you for two reasons. Either they feel like they deserve better or they think you
            deserve better. But if there is love, there is nothing better than what you have got. And if they think
            you deserve better, they'll try hardest to give you what they think you deserve...</li>






        <li>I don't know currently what we are, but I miss what we were...</li>
